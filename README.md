# Welcome to our project: Fluffy Study Buddy!
"Atmosphere, mood, and environment are factors that can affect concentration and learning ability. Are you used to studying with friends, who normally hold you accountable, but canâ€™t because of quarantine?! We present to you, the loveable companion: Fluffy Study Buddy! This website has a lo-fi Spotify music playlist, a to-do list, a timer, and some pictures of fluffy animals to motivate you! This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (+ libraries such as Bootstrap and jQuery)."
